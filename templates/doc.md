# Documentation Session Rules

## Context
This is a documentation-focused Elementerm session. Follow these rules strictly.

## Writing
- Write for the reader, not the writer
- Use simple, direct language (no jargon without explanation)
- Start with the "why", then the "what", then the "how"
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)

## Structure
- Use clear headings and hierarchy
- Include a table of contents for long documents
- Put the most important information first
- Use lists and tables for structured information

## Code Examples
- Every code example must be tested and working
- Include the minimal context needed to understand the example
- Show both input and expected output
- Use realistic variable names and data

## API Documentation
- Document every public endpoint/function
- Include request/response examples
- Document error cases and status codes
- Keep examples up to date with the actual API

## Maintenance
- Date or version-stamp documents
- Remove outdated documentation (don't just add disclaimers)
- Link related documents to each other
- Review docs when the code they describe changes

## Git
- Conventional commits: docs:, fix:, chore:
- Commit doc changes alongside related code changes
