# Session Rules

## Context
This is an Elementerm-managed session. Follow these rules strictly.

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
- Keep functions short and focused (single responsibility)
- Handle errors at system boundaries (IO, network, user input)
- No premature abstractions - solve the current problem
- Run tests before considering work complete

## Git Discipline
- Commit frequently with conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:)
- One logical change per commit
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- Always verify `git status` before committing

## Communication
- Be concise in explanations
- Show the what and why, not just the how
- Flag blockers immediately rather than working around them
